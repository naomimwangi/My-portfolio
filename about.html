    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is Naomi Mwangi. My profession background is in Finance.</p>
    <p>I have two years job exeperience in Finance, Junior accounting and administration.</p>
    <h4>Why Programming</h4>
    <p>Well..I have always been fascinated with Tech. Before applying for my business finance course, i knew i wanted to study either Engineering or Computer Science; but we didn't have enough school fees for such courses.
        So i had to choose something to study. Somewhere along my years in school i heard of coding and programming and it instantly became a desire. I knew one day i will have a chance to experience this.
        First forward to last year, in one of many random conversations a friend mentions Moringa and the courses they offer. And now i am here, learning to be a software developer!
